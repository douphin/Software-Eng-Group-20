# Software-Eng-Group-20
Group project for Software Engineering Group 20, it is a personal management app, that will have a calendar and a to-do list. Maybe weather forcasts as well.

### Description
This project is built off of Node.js; The source file for Node.js is Index.js in the main directory; All html files can be found in /public, with corresponding css and js files found in /public/css and /public/js. The jsons used to store user information can be found in /public/json.

### How to get Node.js Running
1. Follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/en) to download Node.js and run the installer
2. Also, download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you don't have it
3. After both are downloaded and installed ( a reboot may be necessary ) open VS Code and then inside of VS Code, open the folder of the cloned repo
4. Open a terminal in VS Code, double check the the terminal path matches the repo path, then run the command `node Index.js` if it works, the terminal won't output anything at all
5. Now, open a web browser and navigate the the URL: http://localhost.8080/ this should display the Index.html file
6. To stop node.js, click into the terminal and press `ctrl+c`

Any changes to Index.js require Node.js to be stopped and restarted
Any changes to the other html, css and js files will only be seen once the browser is refreshed
